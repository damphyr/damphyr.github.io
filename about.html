<h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to Αμπελοφιλοσοφίες (A-mpe-lo-fi-lo-so-FI-es), mostly a site of inconsequential mutterings.</p>
<p>The active term would be blog, but that would imply active participation, feedback, trackbacks, an archive, lot&#8217;s of code and a lot more content.</p>
<p>So welcome to my collection of personal and professional information, which is going to grow until I get bored with it, the money for hosting runs out or something unexpectedly terminal comes my way.</p>
<p>Be warned, throughout the site the languages used are mixed indiscriminately. If you come across uninteligible characters you&#8217;re probably reading greek. There&#8217;s english, german, and a smuttering of spanish too, all happily mixed just the way they&#8217;re in my head.</p>
<p>Understanding is not required.</p>
<p>
My name is Vassilis Rizopoulos and I have been dabbling in software engineering for over 15 years now.<br/>
In this decade and a half what started as a hobby of a would-be electrical engineer became full time occupation.<br/>
Professionally I specialize in "software productivity engineering", a catch all term for the role that integrates the development environment, test automation, continuous integration and deployment, devops and general behind the scenes tooling that enables software teams to concentrate on producing useful software.
</p>
<p>My language of choice is Ruby and has been for the past dozen of years, but I also have several C  and C++ embedded projects under my belt as well as a few C# .NET projects and the odd Java one. I consider myself a programming polyglot and am familiar with a steadily growing list of programming languages. Most of my professional career has been spent working for large industry firms doing really close to the metal stuff, from devices smaller than an Oreo cookie to as large as 60-ton locomotives.</p>
<p>I am one of the co-founders and organizers of <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/117820512877082997368/117820512877082997368/posts">thessaloniki.rb</a> the Thessaloniki Ruby Users group and also had the luck to be part of the organizing committee for <a href="http://euruko2013.org">EuRuKo 2013</a> that took place in Athens</p>
<p>
Whatever free time remains between deadlines and family life goes into open source projects mainly in the Ruby community with the lion's share reserved for <a href="http://github.com/damphyr/rutema">rutema</a> and <a href="http://github.com/damphyr/gaudi">gaudi</a>
</p>
<p>I tweet as <a href="http://twitter.com/arcandros">arcandros</a> and contribute to open source as <a href="http://github.com/damphyr">damphyr</a>
