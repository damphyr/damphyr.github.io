                <h1>One more Ruby user group</h1>
<p class="meta">15 Jul 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>It&#39;s an idea that has been bouncing in my head for months now.</p>

<p>I had reached unprecedented playground fatigue levels (where the sufferer is overcome by feelings of despair at the mention of a playground) and due to the nature of my work had little or no contact with any local hackers/rubyists/geeks.</p>

<p>I love local user groups, I actually started down the path to coding in one such group, in this here <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Thessalonika,+Greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=47.080837,77.783203&amp;t=h&amp;z=11">city</a>. We didn&#39;t call it a user group, we didn&#39;t have internet (it was Fidonet, BBSs and 2400 baud modems back then) and we drank mostly retsina but the spirit was the same.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how long one can procrastinate and even more astonishing how easy and fast one can organize a user group with fellow geeks.</p>

<p>I started by tweeting a question. The answer led to <a href="http://rubyst.es">rubyst.es</a> a greek ruby community site, which unfortunately seems to lack any activity (still waiting on the approval of my registration guys). After a bit of ominous silence and a feeling of dread - currently very familiar in Greece - I reframed my tweeted question and this time I got pointed to ruby-hellug. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mailing list so I fired an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hellug/browse_thread/thread/78dff26014a5ce66/8dc8e5144418f9eb#8dc8e5144418f9eb">email</a> and forgot about it. Or at least tried to. It took exactly 25 minutes for the first email to reach me. Apparently there <strike>is</strike>was no Ruby group in Thessaloniki, GR.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/JEG2">James Gray</a> (James Edward Gray III as I know him ;) ) offered the final push the next day in response to an email for help. Essentially &quot;just do it and get the newbies in, you won&#39;t regret it&quot;.</p>

<p>It was June 22nd. The thessaloniki.rb founders meeting (meaning we went out for beers) took place on July 7th.</p>

<p>thessaloniki.rb #1 (meaning we talked about Ruby and then went out for beers) took place on July 12th. </p>

<p>Reception was very positive. The list has 15 members already, which - taking into account that it is the middle of the summer and traditionally things are super slow here - I consider a huge success.</p>

<p>We even have swag: Our group counts as it&#39;s member the first and (currently) only GitHub employee in Greece ( <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/amiridis">Petros Amiridis</a> in a league of his own) and GitHub rocks when it comes to community support. </p>

<p>Also <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/avdi">Avdi Grim</a> of <a href="http://exceptionalruby.com">Exceptional Ruby</a> fame was extra helpful when I asked him to essentially ripoff his book and make a presentation - not only did he give permission, he offered a generous discount to the group as well. A thousand thanks to you Avdi! </p>

<p>Thanks are due to City College and <a href="http://www.city.academic.gr/csd/eleftherakis/">George Eleftherakis</a> for kindly allowing us to use their space.</p>

<p>We have a group, we have a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/thessaloniki-rb/thessaloniki.rb/wiki">repository</a>, a twitter hashtag (#thessrb - works on so many levels: thess for thessaloniki, thess==&#39;you want&#39; in greek, so thessrb==&#39;you want ruby&#39; etc.), ideas and apparently voracious appetite for learning.</p>

<p>At a time of great hardship and uncertainty meeting a group of intelligent people with energy and drive to learn, help each other and move forward is priceless.</p>

<p>See you all in September!</p>
