                <h1>Ruby Performance: What a difference the compiler makes</h1>
<p class="meta">10 May 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For a long time Ruby performance was not an issue. That changed as soon as I moved from Windows to Mac and started supporting development teams on different systems.</p>

<p>Ruby performance under Windows was(is) an embarrassment (when it isn&#39;t a reason to change development environment).</p>

<p>When writing software like build systems there is the factor of perceived performance which can be best defined as the amount of time between starting a program and the moment the first output is given to the user (the startup time) or the amount of time <em>between</em> screen outputs.</p>

<p>Providing clues to the user might actually slow down your scripts (all those stdout prints cost time) but it gives your user the sense that something (hopefully useful) is happening.</p>

<p>Then there is the real performance and lately I have reduced everything down to a single rule: minimize disk I/O. </p>

<p>For a build system that compiles stuff from source there is only so much you can do, but the rule holds.</p>

<p>When my team labeled our startup time the &quot;Ruby Tribute Minute&quot; I knew I couldn&#39;t ignore the problem anymore. In order to keep up with a rapidly growing code base I had to improve performance: run fast in order to stay put.</p>

<p>The platform is Windows 7 32bit and to make matters worse I/O wise, it&#39;s a virtual machine.</p>

<p>RubyInstaller 1.8.7p249 with DevKit 3.4.5 was the original installation. The update is RubyInstaller 1.8.7p334 with DevKit 4.5.1 and recompiled native gems.</p>

<p>Using the same codebase and running over the same amount of code the following graph shows the performance boost that Ruby gets from using a newer compiler on Windows.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ruby_performance.png"/></p>

<p>That first bar is very important. It&#39;s a rake -T, the closest thing to measuring the RTM. The p249 version needs <strong>11 seconds</strong> while the p334 version under 5 (the same operation on my MacBook Pro needs 2 seconds but the comparison is useless since there are less cores and no VM)</p>

<p>The test is very realistic, in that it&#39;s a sequence of rake calls from a living, growing build system: -T, clean, generate, build-1, build-1, build-2, build-2.</p>

<p>The last four measure time for a full rebuild and the minimum incremental build time for our two main targets. Where the compiler actually does the bulk of the job (bars 5 and 7) there is no gain but in every other aspect the new RubyInstaller version is faster and <em>feels</em> faster - it actually feels faster than it is, which goes a long way to placate my team members.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually quite interested to see what 1.9.2 performance looks like, but need to work out some incompatibilities first.</p>

<p>All I can do is send a great big thanks to Luis Lavena and the RubyInstaller team for doing such a great job and improving the Ruby experience on Windows immensely.</p>
