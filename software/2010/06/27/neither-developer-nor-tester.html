      <h1>Neither developer, nor tester</h1>
<p class="meta">27 Jun 2010</p>

<div class="post"><p>I work as a software developer. A developer who doesn’t really like testing so much - so many more interesting problems to solve, so much more functionality to improve, why spend time writing tests?</p>

<p>“Wait a minute there”, you will say, “haven’t you created a testing tool? Don’t you spend most of your time talking about testing, how to test stuff etc.?”.Well, yes and no.</p>

<p>I am an engineer. Trained as an engineer, I think like one: Take a problem, define it’s  parameters, devise a solution, identify edge cases, make sure the solution stays within the parameters.</p>

<p>The creative “destruction” really good testers bring to the game eludes me, because I think in solutions and that narrows my scope. 
But as a <i>software</i> engineer I also think about what will happen if something changes. Trying to foresee change is a sure way to bloated software and unmanageable featuritis ending with a (s)crap heap.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/metal_heap.jpg" title="Featuritis in action" alt="(s)crap heap" /></p>

<p>So in my engineer’s mind tests serve to identify breaking changes as well as proof of a working solution, building insurance for the future.
This is a limited view of testing, as it concentrates on the normal flow and the few variations and error cases identified during the design.</p>

<p>You could say that as a software engineer I am interested in tests for their initial validation of the logic and their usefulness in detecting regressions.</p>

<p>What I can say is that I am not really  interested in actually running tests. From the engineering point of view, this is a job for the computer, a very interesting “problem” to solve, hence <a href="http://github.com/damphyr/rutema">rutema</a>, a tool for automating test execution.</p>

<p>Devising tests, now that is a whole craft, a way of thinking, requiring skill, intelligence and quite a bit of discipline. Just like what is needed to write software anyway, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Good testers approach the solution as a problem, deconstruct it and find the holes. Discipline is essential - wildly clicking on a GUI might net you a few errors, but if you cannot reconstruct them there is no test and no value.</p>

<p>Good judgement, imagination and discipline are not automate-able. You need a tester, a good tester, first. And you need him/her in the team, in regular contact with the developers, exchanging ideas, pointing out design flaws, helping shape your software.</p>

<p>Automation is necessary whenever there is repetition. Originality is required before it, and that you can only get from a good tester.</p>
