      <h1>Vagrant with QNX Neutrino</h1>
<p class="meta">18 Oct 2013</p>

<div class="post"><p><em>If you don’t know what QNX is don’t be scared, but if you don’t know what vagrant is this post is probably not for you :) </em></p>

<p>Most of my career I have lamented not being able to use the best and most exciting tools because they just won’t work for whatever I have to get running at the time.</p>

<p>Working with Windows you learn very fast to not expect much comfort, or support, or sane functioning command line interfaces for that matter. But I love edge cases, they represent a chalenge.</p>

<p>So for the past week or so I have been putting together a setup for QNX Neutrino 6.5 machines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/neutrino-rtos/neutrino-rtos.html">QNX Neutrino</a> is a real time operating system offered by QNX Software Systems which apparently belongs to RIM now. It’s a nifty microkernel RTOS, very Unix-like, more BSD than Linux in some ways and you can add all kinds of open source goodies to it.</p>

<p>QNX is also very kind and offers a VMWare VM with the latest version of the OS. For the task at hand that was a godsend. So I made a few copies and started experimenting with the setup until it was done.</p>

<p>And then the yak shaving started.</p>

<p>See, every time I made a mistake I just deleted the VM, made another copy from the QNX master and continued the work. Sounds familiar?</p>

<p>It’s more or less the vagrant work flow: Define your VM, do <em>vagrant up</em> to start it, do the work with <em>vagrant ssh</em> and when you’re finished <em>vagrant halt</em> or <em>vagrant destroy</em> if you went too far. The idea was to use a shell provisioning setup and easily test the setup scripts.</p>

<p>How hard can it be to build a vagrant basebox for QNX? Considering it’s 23:00 and I started this at around 19:00 I would not say it’s easy.</p>

<p>##Creating the basebox
The QNX VM came in VMWare format, I have a VM Workstation license and there is a (commercial) vagrant plugin for VMWare which I promptly acquired. I did not want to go through the trouble of converting the QNX VM from VMWare to VirtualBox just in case the yak became a yak herd.</p>

<p>Before we package the whole thing there are a few things that need to be done on the QNX VM to allow vagrant to work with it. Everything listed is run as root.</p>

<p>###Setup sshd</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /bin/sh</span>

<span class="c">#setup ssh access </span>
random <span class="nt">-t</span>
<span class="c">#use emtpy passphrases</span>
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa <span class="nt">-f</span> /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key <span class="nt">-b</span> 2048
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa <span class="nt">-f</span> /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> dsa <span class="nt">-f</span> /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
<span class="c">#and start the server</span>
/usr/sbin/sshd&amp;</code></pre></figure>

<p>Also, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add the line <em>/usr/sbin/sshd&amp;</em> at the end so that sshd starts when the machine reboots.</p>

<p>###Setup the vagrant user
I really dislike this because I have not found a way to automate it further. You need to go through the passwd questions manually.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#! /bin/sh</span>
<span class="c">#Accept default values and use vagrant as the password</span>
passwd vagrant</code></pre></figure>

<p>After this you need to add ‘users:x:100:’ at the end of /etc/group</p>

<p>###Passwordless ssh access
Get the <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/keys/vagrant.pub">vagrant insecure public key</a> and copy it into /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys. Then to make sure do the following</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">chown</span> <span class="nt">-R</span> vagrant:users /home/vagrant/.ssh
<span class="nb">chmod</span> <span class="nt">-R</span> 700 /home/vagrant/.ssh</code></pre></figure>

<p>If the permissions are not set corretly openSSH will not login succesfully (and you will not know why!)</p>

<p>###Actually create the base box
The basebox format is actually very basic: Whatever VM files your provider requires to start the VM plus a metadata.json file with the following content:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="err">provider:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"vmware_workstation"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Values that are valid at the time of writing are “vmware_workstation”, “vmware_fusion” and “virtualbox”.</p>

<p>For VMWare VMs the following should do the trick when run in the VMs directory.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">tar </span>cvf qnx65.box <span class="k">*</span>.vmdk <span class="k">*</span>.vmx <span class="k">*</span>.vmxf <span class="k">*</span>.nvram metadata.json</code></pre></figure>

<p>(add the .json file yourself :) )</p>

<p>##Enter Vagrant
So we do the <em>vagrant init</em> and edit the Vagrantfile</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="s2">"2"</span>

<span class="no">Vagrant</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">configure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">box</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"qnx65"</span> 
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">vm</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">box</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"qnx65.box"</span> <span class="c1">#No real URL, the basebox was just in the same directory</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first <em>vagrant up</em> needs to specify the provider otherwise vagrant defaults to Virtualbox</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vagrant up <span class="nt">--provider</span> vmware_workstation</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, if you did not setup ssh correctly then vagrant is going to hang with “Waiting for VM to boot. This can take a few minutes”. This can be easily ascertained if you set the environment variable VAGRANT_LOG=debug and watch how vagrant repeatedly tries to connect and fails miserably never giving up. Go back and set those permissions…</p>

<p>If you have setup ssh correctly then you’re going to get a “The guest operating system of the machine could not be detected!”. So much for Unix-like.</p>

<p>Fun fact: If ssh is not correctly setup and <em>vagrant up</em> hangs, then you can control-C and then try <em>vagrant halt</em>. After an inordinate amount of time the VM is going to  shutdown. If ssh does work then <em>vagrant halt</em> will die horribly complaining that it cannot recognise the OS.</p>

<p>Which means that there’s going to be a continuation to this adventure, where we dwell into the creation of a vagrant guest plugin. This yak is not yet completely shaved.</p>
