<div class="post">
<p>I am forced to write Object Pascal code in order to accomodate an obscure in-house testing tool. Obviously there is no way I still remember all the constructs of the language after 15 years.
<i>panicky parenthesis</i>
Oh, my god, it&#39;s been 15 years since I last coded in Pascal!
Oh my god, I have coded in Pascal!
<i>end of panicky realisation</i>
So I looked around for references (found them too). </p>

<p>While looking I stumbled on the classic <a href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html">&quot;Real Programmers Don&#39;t Use Pascal&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Having been a &#39;junior&#39; Pac-Man player and a 12 year old who blew Real Programmers out of the water in Pac-Man and Asteroids (at about the time the article was written too) I just had to compare. I can only conclude that I am some strange (d)evolutionary hybrid:
<ul>
<li>I write self-modifying code just like a Real Programmer.</li>
<li>I programmed IBM 4371 VM/SP and used AS/400 instead of OS/370, but I love that &#39;video-game&#39; Unix.</li> 
<li>I have a line-printer printout with ASCII art taped on the wall. It&#39;s not a calendar and it&#39;s from 1991 (same year I last coded in Pascal).</li>
<li>I have coded in Assembly (6502, 68000 and x86) but also in Pascal, while my Fortran contribution does not exceed 30 lines</li>
<li>A language with structure, a language with data types, strong typing, and semicolons makes me shiver. Give me untyped, dynamic Ruby and I will do the job</li>
<li>I definitely use source code maintenance systems, although I still have code in 5.25&#39;&#39; floppies (sorry, too young for punch-cards).</li>
<li>The language I adopted is dead simple but it&#39;s interesting features do include &quot;methods for messing with the operating system and rearranging memory&quot;</li>
</ul>
Where I definitely do better is the no neckties, no high heels, no 9 to 5, &#39;arrive at work in time for lunch&#39; (when I get to go to the office) list. 
Being able to cook is something attributed to a non anglo-saxon origin more than anything, and I cannot remember the EBCDIC character table but I bet I am one of few who know what it was. 
A 12 year old Counter Strike player doesn&#39;t even know how to pronounce it, let alone what it is.</p>

<p>But most important of all, there are &quot;ill-defined goals, bizarre bugs, and unrealistic schedules&quot; where I had to jump in, Solve The Problem, and save the documentation for later.
Not bad for a Pac-Man kid.</p>
