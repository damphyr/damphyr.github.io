<p class="meta">06 Jun 2019</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;ve been doing work with Azure Devops lately and since there&#39;s things to learn, there will be blog posts.</p>

<p>Now I am well known for my vitriolic views on Microsoft&#39;s approach to ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) which were mainly represented in TFS, a behemoth that is now in its 5th (?) rebranding phase. Only this time it looks more like a reincarnation. It has been 13 years since they first gave it a go after all.</p>

<h2>First impressions</h2>

<p>The complexity is now mostly gone, hidden away. This is a good thing.
You can still trace Microsoft&#39;s need to satisfy enterprise policies and wierd gate-keeping bureaucracy, but these things are mostly hidden in security and access policy configuration pages. And the defaults are finally sane.</p>

<p>The mainly point-and-click GUI driven way of doing everything is still there and it is still offered as the &quot;way to do things&quot; but at least the docs make it obvious that there is a way to script <em>everything</em> and that it is there from the beginning.</p>

<p>So, usable and dare I say, promising.</p>

<h2>Things to come</h2>

<p>There&#39;s very little I will be able to say about issue tracking, the default Agile/Scrum issue tracker with the standard boards more than covers whatever requirements I have for maintaining a backlog. My job is to get automation up and running: builds, tests, packaging and deployment.</p>

<p>You will notice I avoid saying &quot;DevOps&quot; and CI. The first does not apply to me individually, but to my team, and the second is a byproduct of getting all the things right (i.e. if we get the automation right and we apply it to every change <em>then</em> we will have CI)</p>

<p>On the other hand, expect a lot on pipelines and how they get implement in Azure Devops.
Getting a single build for a single tech up and running is ridiculously easy - the system analyzes your code and pretty much serves you the build jobs on a platter.</p>

<p>But I never have a single build or a system that uses a single tech, do I?</p>
