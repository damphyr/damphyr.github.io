                <h1>Cars: To drive or not to drive?</h1>
<p class="meta">30 Aug 2015</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I don&#39;t own a car and on the rare occasions I need one, I rent. So I get to drive lots of different cars and most of them brand new. In my daily slog I don&#39;t use a car, it&#39;s trains, trains, trains. Wouldn&#39;t use a car even if I owned one. Which in hindsight is probably why I enjoy driving so much.</p>

<p>This summer I got to drive a lot in Greece and the UK. All the rentals came equiped with cruise control (for the curious: a Pegeuot 307, a Honda Jazz and a Ford Kuga) and initially the novelty of the feature was a fun game. Then I drove on the M62 in England and was glad for it because it made obeying the draconian speed limits simpler and easier. </p>

<p>The empty expanse of a three lane motorway stretched infront of me and begged me to drop my foot on the gas pedal like a lead weight. Cruise control kept me in check. And then I got bored. Driving isn&#39;t really fun on the motorway.</p>

<p>I enjoy complex things and driving is one of the most complex activities we undertake: In a manual transmission car it requires the coordinated but independent actions of all four limbs while processing audio and visual sensory input and all of this moving at high speeds in a chaotic system. </p>

<p>An automatic transmission takes the left foot out of the equation, cruise control does the same for the right (for certain motorway stretches - don&#39;t ever use cruise control on the mountains of Greece, it won&#39;t turn out OK). </p>

<p>It&#39;s an approximation of how it will feel in a self-driving car. Only it&#39;s not, because you &#39;re still on constant alert, actively scanning with peripheral vision, judging the relative speeds of cars in front, steering etc. All I can say is, bring me the self-driving car, I don&#39;t like this stressful in-between state.</p>

<p>I am all for self-driving cars, even considering the <a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/self-driving-trucks-are-going-to-hit-us-like-a-human-driven-truck-b8507d9c5961">downsides</a>. The benefits are overwhelming.</p>

<p>Imagine an electric self-driving car: It needs no transmission, no pedals, no steering wheel. It can be symmetric, doesn&#39;t need to have a designated front or back. It&#39;s going to be lighter and roomier, will move faster through roads with no traffic jams, consume less energy and have better active/passive safety than anything with a slightly sleepy, distracted driver.</p>

<p>Driving should be consigned to a hobby, much like riding horses is. Riding horses is unarguably the more useful skill to have in a post-apocalyptic society but I find the complexity of driving appealing.</p>
