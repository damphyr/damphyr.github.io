      <h1>Things you should know while dating a computer programmer</h1>
<p class="meta">20 May 2010</p>

<div class="post"><p>This was inspired by <a href="http://bit.ly/a7yub9">5 things you should know before dating a journalist</a>, which I found quite funny (while itching to deconstruct - which I won’t do).</p>

<h2 id="1-google-is-our-friend">1. Google is our friend</h2>

<p>…and Twitter, Facebook etc…
If you are of a “dating age” then you have a life online and we have the means to expose it.</p>

<p>If you have a life online, you have a computer and we know how it works.</p>

<p>And the best part is, you will give us your passwords, surrender your laptops and let us configure your smartphones, because, hey… we know how to fix it.</p>

<p>So it’s best you don’t try to hide anything. We don’t have to find things out, your computers will tell us.</p>

<h2 id="2-we-like-our-toys">2. We like our toys</h2>

<p>Be it computers, cameras, remote controls or actual toys.</p>

<p>Inquisitive brains like to fiddle with things, find out how they work, what makes them tick and how to make them do new and interesting things.</p>

<p>With the right application domain, you could be in for the time of your life.</p>

<h2 id="3-you-will-be-tuned-out">3. You will be tuned out</h2>

<p>Programming requires attributes that at extremes would be considered autism.</p>

<p>Present us with an interesting enough problem and we will tune the world out.</p>

<p>Present us with a boring subject and we will tune the world out.</p>

<p>You need to find the right balance of subjects and alternation velocity.</p>

<p>Be careful of the “black hole” subject though. This is a subject that once breached will create an endless monologue of minute details that will kill anything and everything by sheer force of boredom.</p>

<p>And never, ever, put two geeks that share the same “black hole” subject in the same room. 
You are guaranteed a super massive black hole that will suck your conversational universe, compact it and eliminate it in the vortex of incomprehensible detail that is stored in the programmer’s mind.</p>

<p>Add an internet connection and you might never get out alive.</p>

<h2 id="4-dont-ask-us-to-fix-your-computer">4. Don’t ask us to fix your computer.</h2>

<p>Especially don’t ever utter the words “I have this problem with my computer, maybe you could help me…” within a month of meeting, even if it is a pretext for luring the target to your bedroom.</p>

<p>There is nothing more boring than cleaning up a Windows installation for the Nth time and the aversion effect is immediate.</p>

<p>Let it be known there is a problem (“darn, my laptop started acting up again”), let them offer, never ask.</p>

<p>For more repercussions see also 1.</p>

<h2 id="5-variation-guaranteed">5. Variation guaranteed.</h2>

<p>Programmers vary wildly, in personality, in interests, in body shapes.</p>

<p>You could claim above average intelligence until you see the state some software projects end up in, so no, anything goes.</p>

<p>You better consciously avoid stereotypes (the geek, the nerd, the asocial, the unwashed etc.) and keep an open mind.</p>

<p>Surprises, good and bad, are part of living.</p>
