                <h1>Things you should know while dating a computer programmer</h1>
<p class="meta">20 May 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This was inspired by <a href="http://bit.ly/a7yub9">5 things you should know before dating a journalist</a>, which I found quite funny (while itching to deconstruct - which I won&#39;t do).</p>

<h2>1. Google is our friend</h2>

<p>...and Twitter, Facebook etc...
If you are of a &quot;dating age&quot; then you have a life online and we have the means to expose it. </p>

<p>If you have a life online, you have a computer and we know how it works.</p>

<p>And the best part is, you will give us your passwords, surrender your laptops and let us configure your smartphones, because, hey... we know how to fix it.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s best you don&#39;t try to hide anything. We don&#39;t have to find things out, your computers will tell us.</p>

<h2>2. We like our toys</h2>

<p>Be it computers, cameras, remote controls or actual toys. </p>

<p>Inquisitive brains like to fiddle with things, find out how they work, what makes them tick and how to make them do new and interesting things.</p>

<p>With the right application domain, you could be in for the time of your life.</p>

<h2>3. You will be tuned out</h2>

<p>Programming requires attributes that at extremes would be considered autism. </p>

<p>Present us with an interesting enough problem and we will tune the world out.</p>

<p>Present us with a boring subject and we will tune the world out.</p>

<p>You need to find the right balance of subjects and alternation velocity.</p>

<p>Be careful of the &quot;black hole&quot; subject though. This is a subject that once breached will create an endless monologue of minute details that will kill anything and everything by sheer force of boredom. </p>

<p>And never, ever, put two geeks that share the same &quot;black hole&quot; subject in the same room. 
You are guaranteed a super massive black hole that will suck your conversational universe, compact it and eliminate it in the vortex of incomprehensible detail that is stored in the programmer&#39;s mind. </p>

<p>Add an internet connection and you might never get out alive.</p>

<h2>4. Don&#39;t ask us to fix your computer.</h2>

<p>Especially don&#39;t ever utter the words &quot;I have this problem with my computer, maybe you could help me...&quot; within a month of meeting, even if it is a pretext for luring the target to your bedroom.</p>

<p>There is nothing more boring than cleaning up a Windows installation for the Nth time and the aversion effect is immediate.</p>

<p>Let it be known there is a problem (&quot;darn, my laptop started acting up again&quot;), let them offer, never ask. </p>

<p>For more repercussions see also 1. </p>

<h2>5. Variation guaranteed.</h2>

<p>Programmers vary wildly, in personality, in interests, in body shapes. </p>

<p>You could claim above average intelligence until you see the state some software projects end up in, so no, anything goes.</p>

<p>You better consciously avoid stereotypes (the geek, the nerd, the asocial, the unwashed etc.) and keep an open mind.</p>

<p>Surprises, good and bad, are part of living.</p>
