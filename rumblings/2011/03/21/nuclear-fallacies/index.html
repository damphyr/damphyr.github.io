                <h2>Nuclear fallacies</h2>
<p class="meta">21 Mar 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I was trying to figure out what could possibly be the reason for maintaining a nuclear plant.</p>

<p>Lets take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_I_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Fukushima</a>. It generates 4.7 GWe which is a lot of electricity, so initially I thought, OK, you get all that energy from 6 reactors that don&#39;t take all that much space, means you can cram a lot more than you would by, say solar panels.</p>

<p>I mean you need some 3000 square meters of space for a 100KWp solar panel installation. If you want to add solar tracking you need more space so lets be generous and say we need an acre (4046 square meters) for 100KWp.</p>

<p>To get to the 4.7 GW produced by Fukushima we would then need an area of approximately 1880 acres (that&#39;s ~76 million meters) - bare with me, I know full well that comparing the power plant output with the nominal power measurements of PV panels is a stretch so this is just a mental exercise to provide scale.</p>

<p>Fukushima occupies 865 acres of land! That is 3500000 (three and a half million square meters) which if covered by solar tracking PV would theoretically generate 116MW.</p>

<p>To be more realistic let us take a real world PV installation. <a href="http://www.soleaag.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=102:inbetriebnahme-des-567-mwp-solarparks-koeching-ii&amp;catid=1:aktuelle-nachrichten&amp;Itemid=58&amp;lang=en">Koeching II</a> is a 5.6 MW installation on an area of 15 hectares (that&#39;s 150000 square meters, some 37 acres). For the area of Fukushima that would give us 130MW. </p>

<p>OK, you need a looot more space to generate the electricity with solar panels. But that is with the current underfunded and ignored state of technology.</p>

<p>Now imagine the 20 mile evacuation radius (aproximately 3200 square <strong>kilometers</strong>) around the Fukushima plant with solar panels and windmills. Imagine how much more effective PV technology would be if all the money we spent to &quot;take care&quot; of nuclear waste (never mind the money that go into operating and inspecting nuclear power plants) went into research and development of renewable energy sources.</p>

<p>Keep that picture in mind as you realize that the alternative might have just created another no-go zone on this planet.</p>
