The dotcom bubble burst of 2000 is a traumatic experience for most professionals in the IT sector.<br />
Five years after the collapse of irrational expectations for quick money on flimsy ideas based on immature technologies you still get to hear about it.<br />
I guess for a lot of people the impact was hard but I still don't think that IT professionals with their 30000+ salaries (pick your currency $ or â‚¬ - it really doesn't matter, I'm quoting low figures here) and the continuing demand for their skills have had it hard.
</p>
<p>
Hard is not having to eat, not not having enough to buy a new fridge/car/house/gaming console.<br />
And the dotcom bubble certainly left people without food on the table, but mostly it left people's greed unsatisfied.<br />
It's seems that what was "lost" were huge amounts of money that were never there. No more 35 year old pensioners.
</p>
<p>
Personally I knew nothing of the dotcom boom.
</p>
<p>
My professional career started in '97, right on the crest of the dotcom wave, but the wave was in the States and I was halfway around the world. Just like a tsunami, when it hit our shores it was more than obvious how it was going to turn out (and just like a tsunami it was a disaster close up, but halfway around the world it was just another news item).
</p>
<p>
Some eight years after, I can only say that the years <b>after</b> the dotcom burst were the most lucrative of my life.<br />
I get to work with the cutting edge of software, try new ideas (almost) all the time, travel constantly all around Europe (and only for <a href="/traveling/on-flying-and-terror">fear</a> of 10 hours on a plane haven't been a lot further), get to know people and places and generally find limits only set by myself.
</p>
<p>
I won't stop working at 35 (I will probably have to work until I am 80 or dead, the way things are now, but that is another subject), but then again, what would I do if I stopped working at 35?
</p>
<p>
I would code, cook and travel. That's right! Exactly what I 'm doing now.<br />
So yes, I'm one of the lucky ones: I happen to work in something I like and have fun with. 
</p>
<p>
What the dotcom crash taught me was to control my greed and be happy with what I truly like. Luck comes on it's own afterwards.
