<p>I competed in my very first fencing pool yesterday.</p>

<p>Won three out ten, which was a huge surprise, but I&#39;m bruised head to toe.</p>

<p>Grueling work and great fun. I just wish I could have scored a couple more points against Coyote, but winning against a left-handed opponent  is hard, fighting against a left-handed opponent that moves like Tiramola is impossible.</p>

<p>Most sobering were the two 5-0 losses: they gave a new meaning to the word defenseless.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#39;t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramolla">Tiramolla</a>, he was a comic book hero who could stretch his body in every possible shape and distance (think Reed Richards in the extreme).</p>
